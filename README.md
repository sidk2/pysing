# pysing

Code depends on the following libraries, which can be installed via pip: 
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- tqdm
- numba
- networkx

`pip install matplotlib scipy numpy tqdm numba networkx`

To run the code to produce the plots of temperature dependent physics, run the physics.py script. To produce the block spin plots, run rg2.py.

Parameters for the scripts are generally at the top. For example, you can change the lattice dimension or the sampling algorithm at the top of physics.py.
